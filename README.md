So the motive of this project is to make a JavaScript node js library that will make seed Finding easier than ever before.
As the main language currently used for the job is c lang which is a very low level language.
So i have seen and experienced my self that when some normal programmer want to make a simple seed filter he finds it very intermidiating.
So i decided to convert the most used library for seed finding for c in JS, which is cubiomes.
I m doing it using a node.js api for native addons called node-gyp, which can enable u to make node modules in c++/c.

cubiomes git repo -> https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes

node addons

cubiomes is a really amazing library featuring biome and structure generation.
it dipicts minecraft world generation using arthematic mathematics.
So there are total around 5,000 lines of code in it.
So i highly request to any knowlegables to contribute to this repo by Submitting code for diffrent functions in the diffrent files of cubiomes.
So just put the name of the file (example ==> `finders.c`) and then name of the function u are submitting.
i will go through the submissions and add them if they are relavent.
This will speedup the project a lot.
i will give credits in form of comments on top of the sbmitted functions.
I will really appreciate every single peice of code.
